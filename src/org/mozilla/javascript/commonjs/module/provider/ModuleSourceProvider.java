     * whether and how it wants to honor the contents of the array.
     * @param validator a validator for an existing loaded and cached module. 
     * This will either be null, or an object that this source provider 
     * returned earlier as part of a {@link ModuleSource}. It can be used to 
     * validate the existing cached module and avoid reloading it.

     * returned if the script is not found. {@link #NOT_MODIFIED} should be 
     * returned if the passed validator validates the current representation of
     * the module (the currently cached module script).

     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the module ID is syntactically not a
     * valid absolute module identifier.
